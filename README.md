MyGoproRemote
=============

Control your Gopro in your Recon Snow2 HUD

This little app is a GoPro Remote clone on Recon Snow2 Hud, my first android / java app. 
With it, you can preview the gopro view, launch the record, change camera to photo, see the % of battery
or just see that your gopro is still working.

The communication between the Hud and the Gopro is made by Wi-fi, exactly in the same way that the goproremote or IOS app.
You just need to connect you hud's wi-fi to your camera's network name and launch your MyGoproRemote app.

With this version, you will have :
 - the same screen as your gopro or goproremote
 - the Power and select buton 
 - the Record buton
 - the Preview buton 

You can Power On, Power Off, change Mode between camera, photo, burst and timelapse, 
take movies and photos and preview before record (no preview while recording).

With this version, you can't make change in settings. I will probably add this in the next release.

Requirements:

  Snow2 running the latest firmware (or Oakley Airwave 1.5 probably)
  Gopro Hero 3 with wi-fi on, so normaly Silver, White and of course Black edition

I just have tested with my Snow2 smith Optics goggles and my Gopro Hero 3 Black Edition.

The refresh of gopro's status is made every 2s so be careful of your battery life, the wi-fi consumes a lot. 
DON'T LET THE APP WORKING WHILE YOU ARE SKINNG...FOR YOUR SAFETY AND YOUR BATTERY...

I used partial unfinished "GoproJavaAPI" from Adriano Gonella for my project.
